# EvlavDetection

This project is our submission for the Hack3 hackathon on June 26, 2021. The idea of this website was to prevent plagiarism 
in a time where online learning is this prevalent, and we also have a tool to convert handwritten text into digital text. The
plagiarism tool takes two images of different texts and uses the textual conversion tool to convert them to digital text,
and then returns a percentage amount of how much of the files are plagiarised, and how much is unique. The textual conversion 
is done using Tesseract ORC by Google (and some OpenCV), and the plagiarism check is done using the PySimple library. The
website itself was created using the Python Django framework. Thank you for checking out our project. -Roozbeh
